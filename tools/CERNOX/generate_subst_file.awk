# Create a Epics database substitution file based on the content of DB360 data block in the HNOSS PLC.
# Procedure:
# 1. Create a source file of DB360 file (SIMATIC Manager)
# 2. Export the source file to the operating system
# 3. Edit the exported file: 
#        * leave only the content of the structure in the beginning of the file
# 4. Run this program as follows:
#        awk -f generate_subst_file.awk < input_file > output file
#             where:
#               input_file - the file created in step 3
#               output_file - the generated substitution file
#        For this IOC the command can look like that when running it in Db directory:
#             awk -f ../../tools/CERNOX/generate_subst_file.awk < ../../doc/CERNOX/cernox_list.txt \
#             > hnoss-cernox-calibr.substitutions
